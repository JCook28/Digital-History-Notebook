Alan Turing was born on June 23, 1912 and died on June 7, 1954. He was a British mathematician and a logician that majored in many things. He had a major contribution to the development of computers through his "theoretical and practical work". He had designed an input and ouput system along with a programming system. Not only that, he had also writted the very first programming manual. This system was then used in the first marketable electronic digital computer. With his contributions, he had left an lasting impact and is widely regarded as one of the founding figures of computer science and artificial intelligence. His inventions related to the universal Turing machine and the bombe machine which was used during World War II (Britannica.com).
